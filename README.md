## ðŸ§Š Frostfly Games ðŸ§Š
Good morning! We're an Independent Game Studio ran by some stupid students.
Our goal is to create video games that immerse players with engaging storylines and interesting mechanics, but we will probably fail spectacularly on our way. We are currently developing a psychological horror game called "Delirium".

Delirium is a first-person psychological horror game where you step into the shoes of a traumatized child experiencing their worst nightmare. You find yourself trapped in a closed shopping mall where you are the only person remaining. Left with nothing except your fears, your mission is to escape before your nightmares devour you.
